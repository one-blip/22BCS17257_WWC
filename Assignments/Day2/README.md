# Tic-Tac-Toe in C++

A simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++.

## Features
- Two-player game.
- Interactive board display.
- Win and draw detection.
- Easy-to-use interface.

## How to Play
1. Dwonload the tic_tac_toe.cpp file from:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/one-blip/22BCS17257_WWC/blob/main/Assignments/Day2/tic_tac_toe.cpp
   ```
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ -o tic_tac_toe tic_tac_toe.cpp
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   ./tic_tac_toe
   ```
4. Enter the names of the two players.
5. Take turns to input the row and column number where you'd like to place your marker (`X` or `O`).
6. The game ends when one player wins or the board is full (draw).

## Rules
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to mark a cell with their symbol (`X` or `O`).
3. A player wins if they form a straight line of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
4. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
